# hello-world
This is my first project wich will moslty be a place for me to share some thoughts or ideas, and possibly meet some new poeple alone the way.
My name is ... well thats not imporant. What is important, is how I end up using everything Im learning. I do regret not getting into computers when I was younger, but I was young and dumb. So my journey has only started about a year ago. To be continued.
